# GriftlandsExpanded

Mod for Griftlands that expands the game by adding new cards and bosses. In the future, I would like to add some new enemies and grafts as well. Currently, all the content you get is for Sal only.

## Currently Added

8 battle and 4 negotiation cards for Sal

3 new bosses for Sal's story

Item rewards for killing new bosses

Generous amount of typos and inconsistent formatting

## Installation Guide

Official guide [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116914-early-mod-support/).

1. Go to "[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/" (it should contain save folder, log.txt and other game-generated files)
2. Create a new folder called "mods"
3. Transfer "GriftlandsExpanded-master" folder in there
4. Start a new run and have fun

## Compatibility

Intended and tested for the main game version. Use it with the experimental branch at your own risk.

I can't guarantee compatibility with other mods, but it can probably be used along with other mods that add cards to the game.

## Feedback and Troubleshooting

If you want to report bugs, complain about balance, or give any other kind of feedback please direct it [here](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/118889-custom-bosses-and-cards/).

I am a quite busy right now, so it may take a while to update the mod, but I will try to fix any bugs that will inevitably appear.

Please, keep in mind that this is a mod so it can't be perfectly balanced.

## Credits

Thanks to RageLeague for implementing the bosses into the story.

## What's next?

Adding current bosses to Brawl

Applying prestige effects to bosses

Alternative fight with Oolo and Nadan?

Stuff for Rook will come after that's done
